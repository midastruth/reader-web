/** For some unknown reason, React Aria Components’ Popover and Modal Components
 *  are breaking scroll on webkit based browsers in version 1.11.0. 
 *  It is all the more mind-boggling that the hook we are using for 
 *  the Bottom Sheet don’t seem to be affected by this issue – but it could be forcing
 *  a reflow thanks to its animation. 
 * 
 *  NOTE: This is treating the symptoms and is unsustainable in the long run. 
 *  We have to find the root cause of this issue and fix it, 
 *  especially as TS-Toolkit already resolves this bug
 *  when the resources are loaded into the iframe directly as scroll.
